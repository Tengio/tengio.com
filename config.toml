We’ve got the experience that counts. From apps to SDKs, e-commerce to low-energy systems, we’ve got our finger on the pulse. Our customers – such as Groupon, Gumtree or Adzuna – trust us to deliver outstanding results. Every time. We wouldn’t settle for less. We love technology but we think personality is pretty important too. We like all sorts of random things. Ginger beer. Marathon running. Pen collecting. But we’re pretty sure that mobile is what we do best."

The pair had previously worked together for several years at an established Android consultancy in London – later they contracted jointly on projects. Their dream was to create a company that would set new standards in mobile solutions. They had no shortage of experience to draw on. They’ve worked for clients such as Songkick, JP Morgan, Burberry, eBay (Gumtree), ASOS and Laundrapp. Combining technical expertise with business flair, they’ve built apps that have had more than ten million downloads on Google Play.
